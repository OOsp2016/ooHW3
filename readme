	To run this library system, which I do not consider simple by any means, just follow the console prompts.
	This program is absurdly large, I suffer from Rheumatoid arthritis, the joints in my hands are in 
	immense pain after this program.
	I would like to note I took this class previously, and I reused old code as well as updated it.
	I attempted to organize the code and optimize it but unfortunately some areas are lacking.
	Even with prior knowledge this program still required over 20 hours of continuous typing.
	I couldn't even finish it on time after trying to optimize many areas.
